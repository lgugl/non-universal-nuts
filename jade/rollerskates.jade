      p.info-box-catch-txt NUN - NON UNIVERSAL NUTS<br/>TAKING CUSTOMIZATION TO THE NEXT LEVEL
      p After years of practicing action sports, at NUN we understood that it's not only doing the best trick, it's reading your spot to find a DIFFERENT way to ride it, a BETTER way to ride it.
      p DIFFERENT IS WHAT WE ARE
      p We are looking for riding different and better everyday. What about my snowboard, my skateboard or my skates? At NUN we want our stuff to look as we ride: different and better. Because itâ€™s not enough to match caps and shoes we have developed specific screws with a lot of design and graphics in order to be different and look better.
      p Our first product designed for Longboards, Cruisers and Roller Skates receives positive feedback daily from shops, skaters and roller derby teams who are really excited about having in their hands a good looking, great and innovative product. At NUN, being supported by people who share our passion encourage us to offer you the best product in 2015.
      p Stay tuned, Philippe
