      p.info-box-catch-txt NUN - NON UNIVERSAL NUTS<br/>TAKING CUSTOMIZATION TO THE NEXT LEVEL
      p COMPANY
      p Here at Non Universal Nuts, we specialize in roller skating accessories for the innovative skater. We’re about being different and doing different better than anyone else.  For us, roller skating isn’t just an activity, it’s a way of life. We work hard, skate hard, and wanna look good while doing it. Because it’s not enough for us to just match hats and shoes, we want our skates to have the same amount of self-expression. That’s why we chose our first product to be RADnuts and AdCap. Designed specifically with customization in mind, it features sharp graphics, a light but sturdy build, and aids in bearing protection, making it one of the most unique roller skating accessories on the market.
      p FOUNDER
      p Philippe is a mechanical engineer from Lyon, France with a passion for action sports. His vision of the RADnuts first started while he was still a student in engineering school. Ideas of heightening the look of roller skates plagued his university daydreams. Driven by his aspirations of working in the industry and launching his own company, he worked on rough sketches until he was distracted by his career and life abroad. Philippe’s professional experiences in engineering took him around the globe before he returned home to revive his dream. He spent months working on prototypes until he created what would become the RADnuts. With the caps in hand, he made the journey to the United States and set up shop.

          p RADnuts are a decorative accessory for roller skates that acts as a wheel cap and replaces the axle nuts of the trucks. It aids in bearing protection, keeps you from replacing your nuts, theft deterrence, and looks great.
          
          p#features PRODUCT FEATURES
          p Sleek, lightweight, and fashionable, RADnuts come in a set of 4 and are made from a sturdy polycarbonate plastic material. Each weighs in at just above 4 grams so it won’t weigh your skating down.
